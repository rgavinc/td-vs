# td-vs
Tower Defense game using Game Maker Studio 2

## What is td-vs?
This is a tower defense game that allows you to defend and attack. You can play with others or play by yourself and fight a computer. When it is your turn to defend, you will get some time before the first wave appears to build towers. While you are being attacked you will gradually get more money and will be able to build during that time as well. 

There is one main screen, the battleground (there will be multiple maps). Each player will play on the same map but it will be mirrored. The player attacking will experience fog of war but the defending player will not. While plotting to attack you will see the enemies's battlefield but you will only see its current state when you have vision. During this time you can plan different paths of attack and choose different uniques to use. 

Strategy is really important in this game. You will need to be smart about where you are building towers and where you are sending units. You also need to be strategic with which kind of towers are build and which kind of infantry units are sent out.
